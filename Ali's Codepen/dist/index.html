<h2>How he saved the whole city?</h2>
<h6>Posted on 2019</h6>      
<p id="paragraph-1">Something excited happened.Flash is a super Hero.He is the fastest man alive.he can run at the speed of light and can do a lot of cool stuff.He saves the whole city from criminals.He has some friends whi helps them.Their names are Cisco,Caitlin snow,his wife and more.To understand what I'm about to tell you, you need to do something first. You need to believe in the impossible. Can you do that? Good, because all of us, we have forgotten what miracles look like. Maybe because they haven't made much of an appearance lately. Our lives have become ordinary, but there is someone out there who is truly extraordinary. I don't know where you came from. I don't know your name, but I have seen you do the impossible to protect the city I love. So for those of us who believe in you and what you're doing, I just want to say thank you."</p>
       
<h2 id="post-second">Is he a real hero?</h2>
<h6>posted on 2020</h6>
<p id="paragraph-2">Yes in point of view he is just an imaginary hero.You can him as a fictional character.He is one of the coolest character in the DC Univese.n set for these scenes were Grant Gustin as The Flash, Tom Cavanagh as Eobard Thawne, Jessica Parker Kennedy as XS, Jordan Fisher as Impulse, and Kausar Mohammed as Fast Track.

    Scenes on this night had the 4 hero speedsters facing off against Thawne in a cased in courtyard with extras running around a little bit early on in the scene. Eventually the 4 heroes confront Thawne, and XS yells out at him "its 4 against 1 Thawne". Then shortly after the 4 heroes zip out of frame. A bit later they do more of the scene, with Thawne standing in the middle looking around, as if he is unsure where an attack might be coming from, then they pause, the 4 heroes come in & all make a throwing action at him simultaneously, hitting Thawne, sending him to the ground. Then there is another pause with Flash & Flast Track standing over the body of Thawne, and Tom gets up and leaves the scene, and Jordan comes in & takes his place, then they unpause, and Flash, XS & Fast Track hurry over to the body of Impulse now laying on the ground. Another pause, Thawne comes back in, this time behind them. The trio turn around to see Thawne there, then there is another pause, and everyone leaves except Flash & Thawne, they have a few words, before Flash runs after Thawne, and thats the end of the scene.Professor Eobard Thawne (born circa 2151), also known as the Reverse-Flash , is a 22nd-century metahuman speedster, a descendant of Eddie Thawne , a time criminal, and the archenemy of Barry Allen/Flash as well as an enemy of the legends. Obsessed with Flash, Eobard recreated the accident that gave Flash his powers and became a speedster as well. But after his first trip back in time, Eobard learned that he was destined to become the Flash's archenemy and came to despise the hero, attempting to prove his superiority as the Reverse-Flash and thus became everything he wanted. Contrary to his former idol. Since then, the two speedsters battled each other for many years, but neither was strong or fast enough to defeat the other.

    After learning the Flash's secret identity, Eobard went back in time to kill Barry as a child to erase his enemy, but was thwarted by the Flash from a later time who led young Barry to safety. An enraged Eobard then killed Nora Allen and framed Henry Allen for the crime on his behalf. However, Eobard lost his connection to the Speed ​​Force , becoming trapped in the 21st century. Realizing that Barry was the only way to get back to his time, Eobard carved out a life for himself as Dr. Harrison Wells , the head of STAR Labs , and pushed for the creation of a particle accelerator.

    <h2 >who is thawne?</h2>
    <p id="paragraph-3"><img id="thawne-pic" src="https://www.latercera.com/resizer/WilxRoChVL-uEPOxI8ynnZgpUCU=/900x600/smart/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-copesa.s3.amazonaws.com/public/AMVZZOFYQJF7VJBBD7LS4EGV3Q.jpg" alt="The Pic is not working" title="Thawne">The 22nd century, Professor Eobard Thawne was a scientist obsessed with the Flash. Thawne managed to recreate the accident that created the Flash to give himself super-speed, birthing his own "Negative" version of the Speed Force.[2][3] He became bitter and jealous of the Flash when his idol, having traveled through time, saved a crowd that he had intended to rescue.[4] Thawne ultimately grew to despise his former hero upon traveling through time and learning that he was destined to be the Flash's greatest enemy, and vowed to become the "reverse" of everything the Flash stood for as the Reverse-Flash.[2] The Reverse-Flash and the Flash battled each other across centuries, with neither speedster ever prevailing.[5]
